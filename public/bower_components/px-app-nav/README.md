# Px-app-nav

Px-app-nav is a navigation bar or drawer for applications.

## Overview

Use the px-app-nav to cleanly navigate portions or pages of a application. The navigation can be minimized or expanded to reveal the navigation items, which can have sub items. The navigation can host other web components or authentication such as the px-login web component. Navigation items can use font-awesome icons to better communicate with the user.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
1. node.js
2. npm
3. bower
4. Install the [webcomponents-lite.js polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs) to add support for web components and custom elements to your application.

### Getting Started

First, install the component via bower on the command line.

```
bower install https://github.com/PredixDev/px-app-nav.git --save
```
Second, import the component to your application with the following tag in your head.

```
<link rel="import" href="/bower_components/px-app-nav/px-app-nav.html"/>
```

Finally, use the component in your application:

```
<px-app-nav></px-app-nav>

## Local Development

From the component's directory...

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt sass
```

From the component's directory, to start a local server run:

```
$ grunt depserve
```

Navigate to the root of that server (e.g. http://localhost:8080/) in a browser to open the API documentation page, with link to the "Demo" / working examples.

### LiveReload

By default grunt watch is configured to enable LiveReload and will be watching for modifications in your root directory as well as `/css`.

Your browser will also need to have the LiveReload extension installed and enabled. For instructions on how to do this please refer to: [livereload.com/extensions/](http://livereload.com/extensions/).

Disable LiveReload by removing the `livereload` key from the configuration object or explicitly setting it to false.


### DevMode
Devmode runs `grunt depserve` and `grunt watch` concurrently so that when you make a change to your source files and save them, your preview will be updated in any browsers you have opened and turned on LiveReload.
From the component's directory run:

```
$ grunt devmode
```
