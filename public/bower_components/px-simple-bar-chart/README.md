Px-Simple-Bar-Chart
-----------------------------------------------

## Overview

Px-Simple-Bar-Chart is a Predix Experience ('Px') component.

Use this component to visualize a series or multiple series of numeric values as a bar chart or stacked bar chart. Each series is represented by a sequence of horizontally aligned rectangle bars, the height of each proportionally representing a value. If multiple series are passed to the component then a stacked sequence of rectangle bars will be drawn using a different color to represent each series and a legend to identify them will be drawn above the bars.

The bar colors and legend labels are configurable. The width and height of the component are also configurable. We recommend viewing the demo.html page to become aware of the configuration possibilities. We also recommend using the default settings as they are designed for proper performance.

## Getting Started

From the component's directory...

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt sass
```

### API and examples

From the component's directory run:

```
$ grunt depserve
```

Starts a local server. Navigate to the root of that server (e.g. http://localhost:8082/) in a browser to open the API documentation page, with link to the "Demo" / working examples.

### Local Development

Local development is enabled by running `grunt devmode` (see below)

### LiveReload

By default grunt watch is configured to enable LiveReload and will be watching for modifications in your root directory as well as `/css`.

Your browser will also need to have the LiveReload extension installed and enabled. For instructions on how to do this please refer to: [livereload.com/extensions/](http://livereload.com/extensions/).

This is an example watch configuration:

```javascript
watch: {
    sass: {
        files: ['sass/**/*.scss'],
        tasks: ['sass', 'autoprefixer'],
        options: {
            interrupt: true,
            livereload: true
        }
    },
    htmljs: {
        files: ['*.html', '*.js'],
        options: {
            interrupt: true,
            livereload: true
        }
    }
},
```

Disable LiveReload by removing the `livereload` key from the configuration object or explicitly setting it to false.

### DevMode

From the component's directory run:

```
$ grunt devmode
```

Starts a local server exactly the same as if you had run `grunt depserve` however in addition it also runs `grunt watch` concurrently which will execute commands on file change according to the specified matching patterns.

This is an example `grunt watch` configuration which watches for changes to SASS files, then on changes executes SASS compilation and automatic prefixing:

```javascript
watch: {
    sass: {
        files: ['sass/**/*.scss'],
        tasks: ['sass', 'autoprefixer'],
        options: {
            interrupt: true
        }
    }
}
```

**We hope `grunt devmode` puts your development into *#beastmode*.**

### Options

Options are passed into the component as attributes on the element tag.

##### chart-data

Send your data to the component via the `chart-data` attribute which defines the series data to be charted. It needs to be passed in as a multi-dimensional array containing one or more arrays of numeric values.

```html
<px-simple-bar-chart
    chart-data="[ [1,2,3] ]">
</px-simple-bar-chart>

<px-simple-bar-chart
    chart-data="[ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ]">
</px-simple-bar-chart>
```

##### width and height

Set the `width` and `height` attributes to define the target pixel width and height of the chart component. The default settings are 283 by 150.

```html
<px-simple-bar-chart
    ...
    width="370"
    height="230">
</px-simple-bar-chart>
```

###### Automatic width and height for responsive layouts

Set the `width` and `height` attributes to "auto" and the chart will expand to fill it's containing element. *Note: The containing element must be a block-level element.*

```html
<px-simple-line-chart
    ...
    width="auto"
    height="auto">
</px-simple-line-chart>
```

##### legend-labels

Use the `legend-labels` attribute to define custom text labels for your bar chart legend. Pass in the values as an array of strings.

```html
<px-simple-bar-chart
    ...
    legend-labels="['Alpha', 'Bravo', 'Charlie']">
</px-simple-bar-chart>
```

##### colors

Configure custom bar colors with the `colors` attribute. Pass in the desired values as an array of hexadecimal value color strings.

```html
<px-simple-bar-chart
    ...
    colors=['#5da5da', '#faa43a', '#60bd68']>
</px-simple-bar-chart>
```
